# relocator

Service for relocating idle couriers to the nearest location with additional required fleet under stochastic demand in meal delivery platforms.

This is a simple implementation, proof-of-concept, of the relocator service. It is not optimized for performance, but rather for readability and simplicity. Do not use for production purpuses.

Future work: add documentation and unit tests. Also, implement a microservice framework using design patterns.
